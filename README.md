# Integration SDK Examples

This repo provides Appian partners with examples of how to create Connected System Templates and Certified SAIL extensions during the SDKs' beta period. If you are interested in participating in the beta program, please email integrationsbeta@appian.com.

## Connected System Templates (CST) SDK
The Connected System Template (CST) SDK gives developers a toolkit for providing designers with simple, point-click integration experiences. With the SDK, developers can create CST plug-ins that appear alongside out-of-the-box templates like Google Cloud Natural Language or Amazon Machine Learning in the Appian Designer UI.

## Certified SAIL Extension (CSE) and Client API (CST) SDK
The Client API in the CST SDK enables developers to build more complex CSEs with the support of server-side, java-based Client APIs. These Client APIs have access to the configurations stored in their parent Connected System.
